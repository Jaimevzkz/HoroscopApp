# HoroscopApp
My first Compose project. this project is based in the youtuber's [AristiDevs](https://www.youtube.com/@AristiDevs) android intermediate course but with one main difference: I have adapted it to be built with Jetpack Compose instead of the classic Android views system.
## App description
This project consists of an Horoscope Aplication in which you can read every zodiac sign, get a random card to see your luck and read the lines of your hand using the camera of your device.
## Technologies used
In this project I've used an MVVM architecture following the CLEAN architecture and MVVM pseudo-architecture, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit for API Rest and more technologies to be implemented in the project...
